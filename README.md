## deno-crud-api

Classical CRUD API implemented in deno.
For run and test this APIs, type this command in your shell:
```bash
./startup.sh
```
For semplicity, I create a simple script that execute the command for run in dev mode this APIs.

This script (startup.sh) show a simple menu with the user can choose if you run 1st script (api.ts) or 2nd script (app.ts)

## Testing API

Open Postman and do a GET HTTP call to "http://localhost:5000/clients" for a list of all clients
